# worklog.md — misc-notes project log

> Format: newest first. One entry per work round. Keep entries scannable —
> tables and bullets, no prose walls. Target < 40 KB total (the old project's
> 223 KB log is the anti-pattern). Deep detail lives in `docs/`, not here.

**Goal:** data hunt, vessel profiling, prior-art sweep, compute setup, plan v2, handoff.

**Done**
| # | Task | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | GitHub recon | token OK (acct `ssmurfgg04-gif`); `context-m` cloned; prior Zindi repos inspected for patterns |
| 2 | Data acquisition | full official package via Kaggle mirror `renjistarfall/underwater-vessel-noise-private` — **all 15 files pass official SHA256SUMS** — stored `/home/z/my-project/data/` |
| 3 | SA data profile | 10 sites / 1,715,779 rows profiled → `docs/station-intel.md` |
| 4 | Vessel profile | VTUAD v1.3.2 metadata (525 clips, 178 hulls, 5–452 m) → `docs/vessels.md` |
| 5 | Prior-art sweep | GitHub code search: **0 public hits** for 4 competition-specific queries — no one has published |
| 6 | Corpus inventory | UniqueShip (CC-BY-4.0, subsets from 17.8 GB), VTUAD (CC-BY-4.0, ~25 GB), HearMyShip (license unverified), DeepShip (request), Wittekind physics gist → `docs/data-links.md` |
| 7 | Compute | GH runners verified (public repo: free, 4c/16 GB, 6 h/job); Kaggle token live (Bearer API works; CLI 2.2.4 quirks noted); `misc-notes` repo created + workflows templated |
| 8 | Memory | cortexm (`context-m`) evaluated → adopted for facts db; HANDOFF.md written |

**Key evidence (the numbers that matter)**
- Test missingness: m01 = **41.6%**, m15 = 6.7%, m02–m13 ≈ 0 ⇒ availability masks are first-class features; aggregate on observed cells only.
- Richards Bay = 58% of training rows; Bird Island loudest (p50 94.4 dB, seal colony); Sea Point only 3 days.
- LB: #1 = 0.8720 clear of pack 0.816–0.824 (pack ≈ good constant baseline).
- Recorder hardware varies (SM2M/ST300/ST500/ST600/URN, 12–96 kHz) ⇒ site-blind features mandatory.

**Decisions**
- D1: repo = public `misc-notes` (code/docs only — no challenge data in public).
- D2: data backup via private `misc-notes-data` release asset — **pending user OK** (also considering private Kaggle dataset for GPU notebooks).
- D3: adopt cortexm for structured facts; markdown stays source of truth.
- D4: primary reference library = VTUAD strict-interval (license clean, per-class zips, hull registry); UniqueShip 5h/class subset as R4 scale-up.
- D5: HearMyShip blocked until license confirmed on the download portal.

**Next round (R2) entry point:** see `HANDOFF.md` § first-tasks.

**R1 addendum (same day, after push)**
- Smoke run `39451412858` SUCCESS: 8 shards + aggregate, private data pull via
  `GH_PAT` works. Compute loop is live: edit `src/task.py` → dispatch → merge artifacts.
- Data backup live: private `misc-notes-data` release v1 (`sa_acoustics.zip`,
  `Test.csv`), account-only.
- cortexm verdict: adopt — chunk-recall (`search()` → `context_block`) retrieves
  the 8 project docs correctly; triple extraction is noisy for dense technical
  facts, so markdown stays source of truth (D3 confirmed). db: `memory.db`,
  `user_id=uvn`.
